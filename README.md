# Data-Mining-Notes
As I started to dig into machine learning, I realized that data mining is a closely related field, and wanted to know more about it.

These notes are condensed from many youtube and coursera tutorials. 
I take notes like this so that I can look back and find a concept quickly without having to go back to the source materials.

Feel free to look around and point out any errors! I'm open to suggestions to improve them.
